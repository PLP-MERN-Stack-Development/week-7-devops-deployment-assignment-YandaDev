### **Task 5: Database & Storage**
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas for production
- [ ] Configure database connection pooling
- [ ] Set up file storage (AWS S3 or similar)
- [ ] Implement database backup strategies
- [ ] Configure database migrations

### **Task 6: Deployment Platform**
- [ ] Choose deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, Railway, etc.)
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up custom domain
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets

### **Task 7: Monitoring & Logging**
- [ ] Set up application monitoring
- [ ] Configure error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Implement structured logging
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerts and notifications

### **Task 8: Security Hardening**
- [ ] Implement helmet.js for security headers
- [ ] Set up JWT refresh tokens
- [ ] Configure API rate limiting
- [ ] Add input validation middleware
- [ ] Set up HTTPS redirect
- [ ] Configure security scanning

## üèóÔ∏è **Current Application Status**
- ‚úÖ **Frontend**: Modern React app with TechTalkZA branding
- ‚úÖ **Backend**: Express.js API with MongoDB
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication
- ‚úÖ **Features**: Post creation, editing, comments, categories
- ‚úÖ **UI/UX**: ShadCN components with custom styling

## üìä **Deployment Architecture**
```
Internet ‚Üí Load Balancer ‚Üí Frontend (Vercel)
                      ‚Üì
              Backend API (Railway)
                      ‚Üì  
          Database (MongoDB Atlas)
                      ‚Üì
          File Storage (AWS S3)
```

## üîß **Tech Stack for Production**
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (deployed on Vercel)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (deployed on Railway)
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or Cloudinary
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking
- **Domain**: Custom domain with SSL

## üöÄ **Next Steps**
1. Start with Task 1: Application preparation and hardening
2. Set up testing infrastructure
3. Create Docker configurations
4. Build CI/CD pipeline
5. Deploy to production environment
